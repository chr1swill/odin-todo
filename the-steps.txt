The Steps 

- make page link buttons > render  you list on the fly
- make it so changes in a list page will render the list out if the list is render and it does match the current list 
- make logic to delete list[can just me a button on the link page that is render]
- make pages
- test your code 
- make it so that for every list of todo there is only one singlar event listener on it
- make a light mode look good like dark mode
