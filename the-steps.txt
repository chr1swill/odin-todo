The Steps 

- fix bug changing todo list values will not work if it is not the first todo in list
// i think it may be replacing old list with new list instead of adding them which is not desireable

- make page link buttons > render  you list on the fly
- make logic to delete list[can just me a button on the link page that is render]
- make pages
- test your code 
- make it so that for every list of todo there is only one singlar event listener on it
- make a light mode look good like dark mode
